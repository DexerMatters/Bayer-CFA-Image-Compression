# Bayer CFA Image Compression

It is an experimental project on reappearance of compression methods mentioned in the paper 
[Compression for Bayer CFA Images: Review and Performance Comparison](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365087695_Compression_for_Bayer_CFA_Images_Review_and_Performance_Comparison).
